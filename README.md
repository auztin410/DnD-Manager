# DnD-Manager
To help manage your Dungeon and Dragon's games.

Being a nerd myself, I love the adventures and limitless potential for DnD, but anyone who has played the game and especially those who DM games, it can be a lot of work to setup an adventure, no less manage an active campaign.

What DnD Manager allows DM's and players do is allow the application to handle the more monotonous parts of the game, such as inventory management, vendor/loot generation, even a random event generator.

Being someone who loves DnD I wanted to create something that enhanced the game, but doesn't remove the paper and pen roleplaying aspect, but enhance it, the application doesn't not play the game for you, it simply let's you focus on the aspects of the game that are fun and engaging and less time focusing on the more trivial aspects that are important but boring to spend time on.

List of features:
* Login - username, email, password, character, items, spells, and DM/Player(boolean)
* Selection for display players- inventory(weight management option), spells, quests, notes.
* Selection for display DM- all player info sheets/inventory/spells, quests, spell list, loot generator, event generator, creature list/search.
