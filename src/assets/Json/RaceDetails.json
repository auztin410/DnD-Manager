They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. Drown are more often evil than not.",

Elven literature is ric and varied, and their songs and poems are famous amongst other race. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires."

While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep."
